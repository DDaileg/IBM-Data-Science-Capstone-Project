# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
The purpose of this project is to incorporate all of the things learned throughout this course into one project.

Rocket Launches are expensive, costing upward of 165 million dollars per launch. However, Space X advertises rocket launches with costs that are more than half of the amount of their competitors with operating costs being advertised at 62 million dollars. This is because their Falcon 9 rockets have a reusable first stage, which effectively cuts costs. The goal of this project is to play the role of a data scientist working for a rocket company that is a direct competitor to SpaceX. You are tasked with determining the price of rocket launches by building a model based on SpaceX launch data that can accurately predict the success rate of first-stage rocket landings given certain factors.
