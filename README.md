# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
The purpose of this project is to incorporate all of the things learned throughout this course into one project.

The goal of this project is to play the role of a data scientist working for a rocket company that is a direct competitor to SpaceX. You are tasked with determining the price of rocket launches by building a model based on SpaceX launch data that can accurately predict the success rate of first-stage rocket landings given certain factors.
